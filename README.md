I guess this is my second Java game.

I for some reason thought this would take longer because I went into this without much thought as
I just randomly picked what I thought was a small game to make.

It was in fact a small game and really took no time to implement at all, so I thought to just add
a second panel in the main window displaying the player's turn and if anyone won. This also took very little time
but I did learn some important methods attached to the Swing framework that let me do so without much struggle.

This is more just extra practice for me before I try building something more substantial so I am rather satisfied.
